--game logic--
check to see if selected square has already been selected
if selected square has already been selected
    display alert
if selected square is a hit
    remove square from play
    determine which ship was hit
    alert for hit
    if item is dug up, 
        remove itrm from play
        indicate which of the listed items is dug up in buried items list
        if player records 9 hits
            alert user that they have won
            prompt for user to share their score via social media (provide multiple platforms for selection)
                score will include number of shots fired (lower the better) 
            prompt for new game
    if ship has not sunk
        mark square as being played and hit
    


!!! Ignore everything below. May be used in future build of this project.

Definitions:
target grid: The upper grid where the user selects squares which are marked as hits or misses
ocean grid: The lower grid where the user places their fleet of five ships. The COM selects squares which are marked as hits and misses.
COM: the user's opponent, programmed to follow human-like strategies that increase it's probability of recording hits and ultimately winning the game 
live hits: hits that are recorded on the ocean grid, but have not prompted the destruction of the user's ship.
    when multiple live hits are adjacent, the COM will note the orientation of the hits and select adjacent squares that share the same axis (x or y) until the ship is destroyed. Once the ship is destroyed, these live hits become dead hits
dead hits: hits that recorded on the ocean grid, and apply to a user's destroyed ship.
    the COM will treat dead hits the same as any square that has already been recorded as a miss.
--COM logic--
    when player's first turn ends, select a random ocean square
        if miss, mark that square as a miss on ocean grid and end turn
            this square cannot be selected again
            on next turn, select a random ocean square
        if hit, mark that square as a live hit on the ocean grid and end turn
            this square cannot be selected again
                on next turn, COM must select a square vertically or horizontally adjacent to the hit on the ocean grid
            if miss, mark as a miss on the ocean grid and end turn
                on next turn, COM must select a square vertically or horizontally adjacent to the hit on the ocean grid
            if hit, mark as a live hit on the ocean grid and end turn
                if user's ship is destroyed, turn the destoyed ship's live hits into dead hits
                    resume random selection of squares on next turn
                if user's ship is not destroyed, then check for orientation of live hits
                    if live hits are in horizonal orientation, then on next turn select square to the left or the right of the live hits
                        if miss, mark square as miss and on next turn select square to the left or the right of the live hits
                        if hit, mark as hit on the ocean grid and end turn
                            if user's ship is destroyed, turn the destoyed ship's live hits into dead hits
                                resume random selection of squares on next turn
                            if user's ship is not destroyed, then on next turn select square to the left or the right of the live hits
                    if live hits are in vertical orientation, then on next turn select square above or below the live hits
                        if miss, mark square as miss and on next turn select square above or below the live hits
                        if hit, mark as hit on the ocean grid and end turn
                            if user's ship is destroyed, turn the destoyed ship's live hits into dead hits
                                resume random selection of squares on next turn
                            if user's ship is not destroyed, then on next turn select square above or below the live hits
        If COM records 17 hits on ocean grid, the game ends
                        alert user that game is over and they have lost
                        ask if they would like to play again (present play again button)
                            on click of button, start new game and prompt user to place their ships on ocean grid.

NOTES: Random selection of squares by COM may result in selection of a square that cannot logically be hit, due to not enough spaces 
    to fit one of the remaining user ships. WOuld be nice to program COM to ignore such spaces.

   Example: A1 B1 M    If user's destroyer is sunk, the COM should not be able to select A1 or B1, as the smallest remaining ship is
            M  M  M    too large to fit in this space. A logical player would correctly assume that A1 and B1 are misses, and would not
                       select them.
